1. *.txt 
    contains poses representing camera trajectory in TUM format
    column 1:   timestamp(dummy)
    column 2, 3, 4: xyz
    column 5, 6, 7, 8:  quaternion(q0-q3)
    column 9, 10:   dummy gps position in local coordinate system


2. *.g2o
    contains the graph created by orb-slam2. lba=local bundle adjustment
    posopt = pose optimization.
    
    g2o files can be loaded using optimizer.load(), extra constraints can be added on top of this.
    It's one way to simulate bundle adjustment problem, we can delete some landmark vertices if required.
    
    advantage of using g2o file from orb-slam2 is we can work on real world covariance values
